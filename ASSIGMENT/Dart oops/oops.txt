1). What is inheritance?
ans). Inheritance in dart is defined as the process in which one class dervie the properties and characteristics of
another class.It is helpful as it provides an ability with which we can create new class with existing class.

2).Which inheritance is not supported by Dart? Why?
ans).No, Dart does not support multiple implementation inheritance. Dart has interfaces, and like most other 
similar languages it has multiple interface inheritance. For implementation, there is only a single super-class
 chain that a class can inherit member implementations from.

3).What is advantage of inheritance?
ans).It provides the ability to create a new class from an existing class. It is the most essential concept of 
the oops(Object-Oriented programming approach). We can reuse the all the behavior and characteristics of the
 previous class in the new class.

 4).Difference between inheritance and encapsulation
 ans).Inheritance dictates that a child class (subclass) inherits all the attributes and methods from a parent class (superclass).
Encapsulation dictates that one class must not have access to the (private) data of another class.

5).Difference between inheritance and abstraction. 
ans).The main difference between abstraction and inheritance is that abstraction allows hiding the internal details and displaying
 only the functionality to the users, while inheritance allows using properties and methods of an already existing class.

 6).Difference between inheritance and polymorphism
 ans).Inheritance supports the concept of reusability and reduces code length in object-oriented programming. Polymorphism allows 
 the object to decide which form of the function to implement at compile-time (overloading) as well as run-time (overriding).

 7).Can we override static method in Dart?
 ans).Inheritance of static methods has little utility in Dart. Static methods cannot be overridden.

 8).Can we overload static method in Dart?
 ans).

 9).Can a class implement more than one interface?
 ans).Your class can implement more than one interface, so the implements keyword is followed by a comma-separated list of the interfaces 
 implemented by the class. By convention, the implements clause follows the extends clause, if there is one.

 10).Can a class extend more than one class in Dart?
 ans).In the main drive, we create an object of the Circle class and then invoke the methods of the parent class that the class extends
 (Note: Dart does not support multiple inheritances.)

 11).. Can an interface extend more than one interface in Dart?
 ans).Dart has the ability to implement several interfaces. The keyword implements allows a class to adhere to multiple interfaces and increase an 
 object's polymorphic range.The keyword implement is followed by an existing named class whose public fields then become implementation requirements
for the current class.

12).What will happen if a class implements two interfaces and they both have a method with same name and signature?
ans).If two interfaces contain a method with the same signature but different return types, then it is impossible to implement both the interface simultaneously.

13).Can we pass an object of a subclass to a method expecting an object of the super class? 
ans).Yes, you can pass that because subclass and superclass are related to each other by Inheritance which provides IS-A property.

14).Are static members inherited to sub classes? 
ans).Static classes are sealed and therefore cannot be inherited. They cannot inherit from any class except Object. Static classes cannot contain an instance constructor.

15).What happens if the parent and the child class have a field with same identifier?
ans).Sub class field will hide the Super class field. Hidden super class field in sub class can be accessed using super keyword.

16). Are constructors and initializers also inherited to sub classes?
ans).Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

17).How do you restrict a member of a class from inheriting by its sub classes?
ans).We can restrict a member of a class from inheriting to it's sub classes by declaring the member as a private. Because, private members are not 
inherited to sub classes.

18).How do you implement multiple inheritance in Dart?
ans).Dart does not support multiple implementation inheritance. Dart has interfaces, and like most other similar languages it has multiple interface inheritance.
For implementation, there is only a single super-class chain that a class can inherit member implementations from.

19).Can a class extend by itself in Dart.?
ans).You can inherit from or extend a class using the extends keyword. This allows you share properties and methods between classes that are similar, 
but not exactly the same. Also, it allows different subtypes to share a common runtime type so that static analysis doesn't fail.
